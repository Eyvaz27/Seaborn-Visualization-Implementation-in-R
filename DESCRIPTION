Description: Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data 
    Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays 
    containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary 
    semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative 
    plots. Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what 
    the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details 
    of how to draw them
